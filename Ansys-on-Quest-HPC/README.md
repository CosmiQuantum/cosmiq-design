## Using Ansys on Northwestern's Quest HPC

This directory will be populated soone with instructions on how to us Ansys on Northwestern's Quest HPC, for now this will include:

* Running stand alone Ansys simulations (Ansys design created locally and then moved to HPC)
* Simulating Quantum Metal designs with Ansys --> see the [metal_ansys_linux_test](https://github.com/abhishekchak52/metal_ansys_linux_test) repository.

## Requirements to use Ansys on Quest:
1. Obtain a Northwestern NetID, so you can login into Quest. Non-Northwestern folks should be able to get an affiliate NetID.
2. Ask [Firas Abouzahr](firasabouzahr2030@u.northwestern.edu) to be added to the Figueroa/Baxter group's HPC allocation and added to the list of users with access to our Ansys HPC license.
