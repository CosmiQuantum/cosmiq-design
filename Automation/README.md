More details to come but this directory is for codes that help automate the process of going from a GDS design, like that generated by Qiskit Metal, to a CAD file (sat or step) that can be used by Cubit for meshing. I have am also developing automated meshing codes for Cubit that I will add here as well over time.

Right now our design pipeline is: **Convert GDS to DXF (via Klayout GUI) --> Convert DXF to SAT & patch surfaces (via Fusion GUI) --> Meshing (via Cubit GUI)**

That is three too many GUIs in my opinion - we need code.

# Automating GDS to DXF

With the help of AI, I have written this code: [gds_to_dxf.py](gds_to_dxf.py). We still need klayout for this but no longer need to go into the GUI - we can run Klayout API via terminal and call this code to conevert our GDS design to DXF. Run it via command line using:

```
/paht/to/your/klayout -b -r gds_to_dxf.py
```

or if you have Klayout added to your path already you can just directly run: 

```
klayout -b -r gds_to_dxf.py
```
