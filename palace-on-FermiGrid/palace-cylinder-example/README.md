## Comments

This example comes from the AWS Palace github: [Eigenmodes of a Cylinder](https://awslabs.github.io/palace/dev/examples/cylinder/)

* To use these simulation/mesh files on the Fermilab grid they would need be published under ```/cvmfs/Fermilab.opensciencegrid.org/cosmiq ```.

* Note that in [cavity_pec.json](cavity_pec.json) that the path to the mesh file is an absolute path to its location in cvfms: 
  
  ```"Mesh": "/cvmfs/fermilab.opensciencegrid.org/cosmiq/palace-cylinder-example/cylinder_tet.msh"```
